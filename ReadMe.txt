  perpetrator prediction
The data comes from the MAP (Murder Accountability Project). The MAP primary focus is to track and attempt to solve unsolved cases involving homicide. Originally started in 2015, the data collected by the MAP was used to identify murders that were related to one serial killer. The parent site to MAP (murderdata.org) states that the MAP data is the most complete data on homicides available. The data became usable due to the FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) and the collaboration between the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigators) and the United States local police agencies. In total the MAP holds records of more than 800,000 homicides that are solved and unsolved. 
The homicide data from MAP has been cleansed and formatted from the original database. The total number of cases is 638,454 in which 220,000 cases have not been solved. In other words: the perpetrator has not been identified. One of the main reasons of making the murder data freely accessible was to be able to tackle unsolved cases. 
If it were possible to learn from this dataset to be able to detect who might commit a murder or who will be willing then agencies can work to stop them before any harm can be done.  
Your first modeling prediction task consists in creating models that can be used to identify the characteristics of the murder. This will help agencies in the future look for a specific type of person depending on the details of the crime. If we know the crime’s place and the victim’s race, sex and age, it may be possible with high accuracy to build a profile of the suspect. 
The second prediction task consists in creating a linear model that will allow us to predict the number of homicides in the upcoming years. Once a linear model is built it can be applied to each individual city.
